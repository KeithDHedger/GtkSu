Gtksu - what is it?

Simple its a simple replacemnet for gksu/ktsuss etc that alows you to run a program with diferrent priviliges ( root etc ).

Although there are other programs of theis type most if not all rely on polkit or have a large number of dependencies, apps like ktsuss which this app was inspired by ( avaiable here:http://ktsuss.googlecode.com/files/ktsuss-2.tar.gz ), some like ktsuss seem to have been abandoned ( last commit was 2011 ).

Also it seems that whenever polkit ( which is a nightmare! ) is updated these programs break, so this is the result there are few dependencies a reasonable recent gtk and glib and thats it.

Installation

Just run ./autogen.sh from this folder then make and sudo make install.
To install to ( say ) /usr instead of the default /usr/local, add --prefix=/usr, --enable-ktsuss-link will as it says link ktsuss to gtksu so that some programs that hard code the files think that ktsuss is being used ( spacefm ).

Usage:

gtksu [OPTION] [--] <command>
Run a command as another user
-u, --user USER			Runs the command as the given user
-m, --message MESG		Change default message in ktsuss window

Simple usage:
gtksu terminal.

If you need to add options use -- like so:
gtksu -u root -- terminal --hold -x ls -AF /

This programme has the potential to hose your system if used unwisely, BE WARNED!
May present a security risk so use at your own risk.

Bugs etc to the above email address.
